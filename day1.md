 # INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
# 1.Introduce yourself
My self vijay i am from gulbarga.
I have completed my BE graduation in PDA college of engineering by 2022.
I have done one academic project based on arduino ie **RIVER WATER SURFACE GARBAGE CLEANING ROVER**  with a motive of reducing the extent of death rate of aquatic animals and water pollution.
with team support our project has been **selected by the VTU** this is our greatest achievement in our academics apart from that i participated in social responsibilities such as **blood donation camp and grow green**

# 2.Tell me about python?
- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991.
- python has so many featutres and characterstics
- it is easy to read and write
- The important feature of python is the it is dynamically typed ie there is no need to declare the type of varible it automatically took the type during run time
- It is interpreted language ie it executes the code by line by line ie it coverts python source code in to intermediate code called bytecode and then to native language of specific computert to run it
- It supoorts object oriented programming by creating object and classes for to build some applications

# 3.Why Python is so popular now a days?
- due to its readability, shorter codes and ease of writing
- python has so many inbuilt function which are frequently using now a days
- we can run the python source cod ein different operating systems hece it is platform independent

# 4.Features of Python
a. Interpreted**:                
 - There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++, Java
 - Directly run the program from the source code.
 - Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.

b. Platform Independent:
 - Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
        
C. Free and Open Source:  
 - Redistributable
        
e. Simple:
 - Closer to learning Mathematics basics in English medium. Easy to Learn

f. Embeddable
 - Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.
        
g. Robust:
 - Exceptional handling features
 - Memory management techniques in built
        
i. Easy-to-learn:
 - Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. 
 - This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
        
j. Easy-to-read :
 - Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
        
# 5.Advantages and Disadvantages of Python
```
       Advantages                                                                  	Disadvantages
- Simple and Readable Syntax	                                     - Slower Execution Speed
- Large Standard Library	                                         - Not Ideal for Mobile Development
- Cross-Platform Compatibility                                    - Runtime Errors instead of Compile-time Errors
- Integration and Interoperability                               	- Relatively High Memory Consumption
- Support for Multiple Programming Paradigms                     	- Weak in Mobile Computing and Game Development
- Good for Data Analysis and Scientific Computing                	- Difficulty in Implementing Cryptography
- Strong Community Support and Documentation

# 6.INterpreted vs compiler programming language
 ```
           Interpreted Programming                                                     	Compiled Programming
- Code is executed directly without prior compilation.	            - Code is compiled into machine-readable binary code before execution.
- Interpreter reads and executes the code line by line.            -	Compiled code is executed directly by the computer's processor.
- no separate compilation step is required.	                        - Code must be compiled before it can be executed.
- Generally slower in terms of execution speed.                     -	Typically faster in terms of execution speed.
- Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby.                               -	Examples: C, C++, Java.

# 7..py vs .pyc files
```
                     .py Files	                                                       .pyc Files
- These are the source code files written in Python.	           - These are the compiled bytecode files generated from .py files.
- Human-readable and editable by developers.	                   - Not intended to be edited directly by developers; they are generated by the Python            interpreter.
- Need to be interpreted by the Python interpreter at runtime.	  -Can be directly executed by the Python interpreter without the need for further interpretation or compilation.
- Slower to execute since they require interpretation.	          -Faster to execute since they are already compiled into bytecode.
- Require the presence of the Python interpreter to run.	        - Can be executed on any system with the compatible Python interpreter version.
```
# 8.How compilation will happen internally in python
Since python is interpreted laguage it executes code line by line.firstly the source code is coverted into intermwdiate code called byte code and then it is send to to the python virtual machine(PVM) to specific laguage which computer understands

# 9. why python is dynamically typed programming language
- Developers can assign values of different types to variables without explicitly declaring their types, which allows for more concise and readable code.
-  Python enable rapid prototyping and development. Without the need for explicit type declarations or compilation steps, developers can quickly write and test code
-  will not get type error till runtime

# 10. python is platform independent
- Python code can be written once and run on different platforms and operating systems without the need for extensive modifications.

# 11. source code vs byte code
```
    Aspect	                                         Source Code	                                                     Bytecode
Human-Readable                   	Written in a programming language (e.g., Python)                   	Not directly human-readable

Compilation	                      Interpreted and executed directly by the interpreter               	Compiled into bytecode before execution
Execution Speed	                  Slower due to interpretation at runtime	                            Faster due to precompiled bytecode
Portability	                      Requires the source code to be available	                            Bytecode is platform-independent
Distribution	                     Source code can be distributed and shared                          	Bytecode can be distributed as compiled Python files (.pyc)
Modifications                     	Source code can be easily modified and updated	                     Bytecode cannot be directly modified
```
# 12. high level vs low lwvel programming language
```
     Aspect	                                  High-Level Programming Language	                                     Low-Level Programming Language
Abstraction level	                   Higher level of abstraction                                       	Lower level of abstraction
Readability	                          Easier to read and understand                                     	More complex and harder to read
Ease of use	                         More user-friendly and intuitive                                   	More complex and less intuitive
Portability	                         Highly portable across different platforms	                        Less portable, often specific to a particular hardware
Performance	                        Generally slower due to added abstractions and layers              	Generally faster due to direct hardware access
Memory management	                    Automatic memory management (garbage collection)	                  Manual memory management
```
# 13. garbage collection in python
Python deletes unwanted objects (built-in types or class instances) automatically to free the memory space. The process by which Python periodically frees and reclaims blocks of memory that no longer are in use is called Garbage Collection.
