 # INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
# Introduce yourself
My self vijay i am from gulbarga.
I have completed my BE graduation in PDA college of engineering by 2022.
I have done one academic project based on arduino ie **RIVER WATER SURFACE GARBAGE CLEANING ROVER**  with a motive of reducing the extent of death rate of aquatic animals and water pollution.
with team support our project has been **selected by the VTU** this is our greatest achievement in our academics apart from that i participated in social responsibilities such as **blood donation camp and grow green**

# Tell me about python?
- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and was first released in 1991.
-python has so many featutres and characterstics
-it is easy to read and write
-The important feature of python is the it is dynamically typed ie there is no need to declare the type of varible it automatically took the type during run time
-It is interpreted language ie it executes the code by line by line ie it coverts python source code in to intermediate code called bytecode and then to native language of specific computert to run it
-It supoorts object oriented programming by creating object and classes for to build some applications

# Why Python is so popular now a days?
-due to its readability, shorter codes and ease of writing
-python has so many inbuilt function which are frequently using now a days
-we can run the python source cod ein different operating systems hece it is platform independent

#  Features of Python
a. Interpreted**:                
        -There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++, Java
       - Directly run the program from the source code.
       - Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.

b. Platform Independent:
        -Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
        
C. Free and Open Source:  
        -Redistributable
        
e. Simple:
        -Closer to learning Mathematics basics in English medium. Easy to Learn

f. Embeddable
        -Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.
        
g. Robust:
        -Exceptional handling features
        -Memory management techniques in built
        
i. Easy-to-learn:
        -Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. 
        -This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
        
j. Easy-to-read :
        -Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
        
# Advantages and Disadvantages of Python
```
       Advantages                                                                                  	**Disadvantages**
-Simple and Readable Syntax	                                                                   -Slower Execution Speed
-Large Standard Library	                                                                       -Not Ideal for Mobile Development
-Cross-Platform Compatibility                                                                  -Runtime Errors instead of Compile-time Errors
-Integration and Interoperability                                                            	-Relatively High Memory Consumption
-Support for Multiple Programming Paradigms                                                  	-Weak in Mobile Computing and Game Development
-Good for Data Analysis and Scientific Computing                                             	-Difficulty in Implementing Cryptography```
-Strong Community Support and Documentation
